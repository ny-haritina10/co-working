I have a VueJS with TS created with Vite.
Create a VueJS Component for this REST API method who handle the login functionality . 
Here is the API endpoint : 
POST  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/admin/login

Here is the JSON response in the 2 methods:

When it's a success:
```
{
    "token": "6|UUZuO5HuxY3PYgQZosPxbWY72exB4RI9aOHA7V08985823ff"
}
```

When it's invalid:
```
{
    "message": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

I want you to style the Component with Bootstrap. Use icons, modern and elegant Font to enhance the style.
When it's a success store the admin token in localStorage.
Use the best practice to consume a REST API with VueJS project.
